      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
      The design process of this optical illusion was created by light text on a checkerboard for the writing to appear when you look at the composition for few seconds. The composition uses loop to make a checkerboard.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
      The concept of the loop was very confusing to understand. The plus signs and "let" threw me off along with "%","=" signs when I was learning it from the demo videos. However, once I got it, the codes turned very simple and easy to use. 
      The research process was very hard just because the illusion optical had to be in usage other then the usage of just interests.I also wanted to incorporate personal idea in to it, which is why I chose korean to put in as a text. I came up with this optical illusion because it could be deployed in the world around us in browser extensions or to identify as human on browsers.
