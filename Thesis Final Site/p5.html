       The back story from Lu's bunny(head): a rabbit which was unfortunatedly being turned in to a
human being by black magic. She really hates this so sheâ€™s spending decades tryting to find a way to yurn back into a pure rabbit

The back story from Yotian's alien(upper body): Comes from a planet called 'let it rot'. In this planet their hands have evovled to be fingerless beacause they don't need to do anything. The red button on the chest does not do anything, they do not have names. He accidentally stepped into the fall into a hole and come to Earth.

My back story(legs):This character was an human. However, when it was hit by a beam, it turned into a toy, a toy like a lego. That is why the eyes look surprised, and body parts look like they were about to move. 

Overall Story: This monster was originally a pure bunny from a planet called 'let it rot', however, it once fell in a hole and came to the planet called an Earth. There, she met a first human who used the black magic. The human did an experiment on her, and first used an black magic. So, it tried to run away. However, the human shot a beam on its leg so it would not run away. Then, because this rabbit could not do anything, so it turned itself to fingerless monster.

      <p>
      Sketching out each parts of the body and using the functions function was very useful. It was very fun creating a new sketch from the partners as well. However, there was a struggle in the rotate function even though I was using the degrees mode. Overall, it was a fun project which made it easy to understand the functions.
