      <p>
     For this game design, I designed a game like a flappybird, to convey my move from my hometown to New York. I wanted to show that I had many obstacles during this move.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
      I had designed this game starting from the boxes. The code for this game was very complex to me because there were new functions I had to learn. However, when I was finished coding, the images that were supposed to replace the boxes were not working.
