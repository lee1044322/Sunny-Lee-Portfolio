        This project is to explore the difference between the human language and the computer language. The description between two language allows a difference in result of the drawing.

      <p>
       From the description of my partner, I started coding based on the information I was given. Without knowing what the actual object is, I was supposed to rely on the description that was put into human language and transfer it to computer language.

You have to put them into your ears. You can listen to music through this. Itâ€™s made up of two  pairs  and there is a case where you can put them together. The case is rectangular with a round corner. It has a bluetooth function. The color is white.

      <p>
       The description my partner gave was very descriptive. I was able to get clues on what it is since the description contained what the object's function was. The interpretation of my image contained my guess of what the object was. However, because there was not much detailed description on what the exact shape is, I ran into difficulties on creating an image. I had to guess based on the information I already had on the object "earbuds" rather than just relying on the description.
